Dependencies:

- [ ] yt-dlp binary for your OS: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
- [ ] ffmpeg binary for your OS: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

The docker image already contains these dependencies, but if you want to run the bot locally, you need to install them yourself. Currently, due to BUN runtime current's state, you can only run this in Linux or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
